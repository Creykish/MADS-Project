The life-cycle model of consumption, originally proposed Modigliani and Brumberg
(1954) and Ando and Modigliani (1963) [[The Life Cycle Hypothesis of Saving]]

One implication of the simple life-cycle hypothesis is that a retired household should divide its lifetime wealth by the number of years it expects to live and spend that amount each year. The pptimal [[Life Cycle Wealth Trajectory]] can then be expressed as a function of the consumer's resources and the expected rate of return on their capital.

Empirical research, however, finds saving behaviour that is inconsistent with this simple life-cycle implication.
