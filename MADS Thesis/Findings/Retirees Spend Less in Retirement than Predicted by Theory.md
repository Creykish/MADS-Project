Individuals in retirement spend much less (decumulate wealth much more slowly) than the optimal trajectory determined by the [[The Life Cycle Hypothesis of Saving]]. This has been attributed to a number of things, most frequently [[Precautionary Saving]] due to uncertain [[Medical Expenses]] and other events. 


All of this points to a much larger risk aversion than the "optimal" model would suggest. Even though this is partially explainable by real-world events, retiree's generally save or even accumulate wealth in retirement in excess of what is explainable by most models. 

While a preference for [[Bequeathment]] might also explain this risk aversion, this has not been well-supported by evidence.
