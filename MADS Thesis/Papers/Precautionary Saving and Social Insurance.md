## Summary

Micro data studies of household saving often find a significant group in the population with virtually no wealth. They investigate whether this can best explained by means-tested social security, which is based on assets held. They find that means-tested social security can discourage saving by individuals with low expected lifetime incomes. The reason is that savings an wealth are subject to a "implicit 100% tax rate" in the event of a medical event ([[Medical Expenses]]) large enough for the recipient to seek welfare support.
