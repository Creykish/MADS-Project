## Summary

This paper investigated [[Life Cycle Wealth Trajectory]] for real investors. Previous work outlines that the "hump-shaped" trajectory (as predicted by the optimal path determined by the [[The Life Cycle Model of Consumption]]) does not occur in real-world savings behaviour. Data drawn from 12,734 Canadian families in I977.
