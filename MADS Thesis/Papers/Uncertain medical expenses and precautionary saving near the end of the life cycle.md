## Summary

Emprical Evidence has suggested that retirees' [[Life Cycle Wealth Trajectory]] has much slower decumulation more slowly than would be optimal based on the [[The Life Cycle Model of Consumption]]. 

Presents a model of household consumption which considers the retiree's propesity toward [[Precautionary Saving]] in the face of the uncertain costs of  [[Medical Expenses]]. By accounting for these costs, optimal wealth decumulates more slowly which is in-line with empirical data, although actual wealth accumulation is slower yet again, suggesting that retirees are even more conservative than the optimal model.
