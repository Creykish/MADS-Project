## Summary

Modelling [[Life Cycle Wealth Trajectory]] to investigate whether longevity and medical expense risk can explain large asset holdings even at advanced ages. They extend to develop a model that consistent with the following key facts about the U.S. data: women live longer than men, rich people live longer than poor people, and healthy people live longer than sick people.

They find that the risk of living long and
facing high [[Medical Expenses]] goes a long way toward explaining the elderly's savings decisions. Specifically, medical expenses that rise quickly with both age and permanent income can explain
why the elderly singles, and especially the richest ones, run down their assets so slowly. They also find that social insurance has a big impact on the elderly's savings.

Their main conclusion is that to correctly evaluate any policy reform affecting the elderly’s saving decisions, one needs to model accurately the [[Consumption Floor]]and, at a minimum, the average level of medical expenses by age and by permanent income.
