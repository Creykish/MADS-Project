## Summary
Investigated motives for savings and spending patterns after retirement in both countries using survey data.

Found that many retirees hold on to their assets or even keep on saving well into old age, in contrast to the [[The Life Cycle Model of Consumption]].

The desire for [[Precautionary Saving]] explains why retirees hold on to their wealth. Saving motives change if people anticipate major health and mortality shocks ([[Medical Expenses]]).

Differences in saving motives by country reflect  [[Pensions & Social Security]] settings.

Preferred spending is always more conservative in Australia than in the Netherlands.

Important motives for spending and saving after retirement in both countries are the desire to remain financially independent ([[Financial Independence]]) and to ensure that it is possible to enjoy life now as well as later. 

With the exception of inter vivos transfers to a surviving spouse, [[Bequeathment]] is not important in either country.
