## Summary
Developed a measure that converts financial and non-financial assets into a total wealth figure. Used this to investigate [[Life Cycle Wealth Trajectory]] for a panel of retired households between 1998 and 2006. Finds that comprehensive wealth balances decline much more slowly than their remaining life expectancies, so that the predominate trend is for real annualised wealth to rise significantly with age over the course of retirement. 

Highlights the importance of [[Precautionary Saving]] for US-based investors in particular, perhaps related to their relatively high, non-socialised [[Medical Expenses]].
